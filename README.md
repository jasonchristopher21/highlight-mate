# Highlighter Mate

**Version 0.1 (25/12/2022)**

An automated application to highlight, mark and redact* PDFs, built on Python and PyMuPDF libraries.

Highlighter Mate enables you to highlight all instances of multiple keywords, with a friendly text-based command-line interface*.

_*as of version 0.1, further iterations are to be done soon!_

## Getting Started

Highlighter Mate currently requires a slight knowledge of terminal operations to run the program. For Windows users, if you currently do not have a preferred "terminal", you may open Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt instead.

1. Ensure that you have downloaded [Python](www.python.org) in your computer.

2. Download the `pip` installation manager for Python. You may read their documentation [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) <br>
In your terminal, run the following command:
```python
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

3. Download PyMuPDF. You may read their documentation [here](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). <br>
In your terminal, run the following command:
```python
python -m pip install --upgrade pymupdf
```

4. Run the file `highlighter.py` in your Terminal, and follow the prompts provided. :)
